## Project Overview
This study focuses on predicting heart disease in patients at Peterside Hospital using machine learning models. The hospital, located in Lagos, Nigeria, offers various medical services and is known for its advanced facilities and skilled medical professionals.

## Project Objective
- Developing a machine-learning model to predict the probability of heart disease.
- Engineering and selecting the most predictive features to optimize model performance.
- Deploying the model into a production environment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and continuous monitoring.

## Data Preprocessing
- Reading the dataset and assigning appropriate column names.
- Checking for null values and handling missing data.
- Performing exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and identify outliers.
- Creating new features such as age brackets and gender representation for better analysis.

## Machine Learning
The Peterside heart disease prediction  model is built using a supervised machine learning approach. Training and test data was split 60:40. Several classification algorithms were experimented with including but not limited to:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**


## Evaluation Metrics 

The performance of the models was evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision Score
- Recall Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Insights
- Various visualizations were created to explore the distribution of features such as age, gender, chest pain types, and other relevant attributes.
- The age distribution showed most patients were between 40 and 60 years old.
- More males were in the dataset compared to females.
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest were among the best-performing models in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion 
The study successfully developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease, with Random Forest and Logistic Regression showing promising results. Continuous monitoring and maintenance protocols were suggested for the deployed model to ensure its long-term effectiveness.
